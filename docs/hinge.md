## Discover card anatomy

Vertical scroll, one person per card. Five to six full swipes reach the end.

- Photo cards: full-width image, heart at (336, card bottom − 35).
- Prompt cards: white card with prompt label, answer text, heart bottom-right.
- Vitals card: age, height, location, job, school, religion, hometown, dating
  intention, relationship type (each an icon + text row). This is the most
  reliable structured data on the card.
- Floating undo + X are pinned bottom-left and never scroll away.

## Like flow

Tap any heart → like sheet (comment optional, rose optional) → `Send Like`.
To back out: tap `done` to drop the keyboard, then swipe the sheet down from
(195,130) to (195,700). Tapping the dimmed header does not dismiss it.

## Shadow mode

```
IOS_UDID=00008110-000E403E1AC2401E WDA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8101 npm run hinge:shadow
```

The agent never taps. It polls a screenshot every 0.8 s, classifies it, and
groups frames by the header name. A profile is closed when the next name is
read twice in a row; its decision is `like` if the like sheet was seen while
that profile was open, else `pass`. Output under `data/hinge/shadow/<session>/`
(git-ignored): one folder per profile with de-duplicated frames and
`meta.json`, plus `session.jsonl`. Ctrl+C ends the session; the open profile
is recorded as `unknown`.

Known limits: a like sheet that is opened and then dismissed still counts as
`like`; profiles skipped in under two polls are missed; names OCR'd
differently mid-card can split a profile in two.
